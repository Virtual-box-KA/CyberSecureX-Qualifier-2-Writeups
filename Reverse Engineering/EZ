#OUTPUT
rev1: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=255d897838bdcc2288ea7a22b3f7834a44eaf009, for GNU/Linux 4.4.0, stripped
#tried basic commands eg. strings objdump
#Using ghidra search the logic

Using Ghidra, I loaded the binary and explored the function list. The main functions of interest were:
- FUN_001097e0: final flag verification
- FUN_00108d80: checksum calculation
- FUN_00109470: input processing
#Above images are in the media directory

#now we have found what we wanted 
Brute forcing string will take time but will be successful.
You can use GDB which is better.

#After doing all rhe analysis
