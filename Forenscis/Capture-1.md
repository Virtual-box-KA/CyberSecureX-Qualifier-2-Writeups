> The 3 little pigs are the best of friends. But 1 little pig suspects that 2 little pigs maybe scheming behind his back. The 2 little pigs know how to hide messages in network but (fortunately for you) not well enough.

We have been given a pcap file. Let us just check if there is any flag directly written in it.

Let us use:

```bash
strings file.pcapng
````

There is something that makes me happy, The FLAAAAG!

```bash
flag{h3r3_7t_i5}
```

> **My hates to the OC, it was a decoy** ðŸ˜ 

But let us see if there is something else,
Agh, it just says gibberish.
But hey! I see something unusual: **dot, dash**

Probably Morse Code??

Let us try!!!
First, find all the packets in sequence. Open the file in Wireshark and add filter:

```bash
frame contains dot
```

I got the protocol, that's ICMP.

Traverse through all the packets with that protocol.
Write down those dots and dashes.

Decode from the Morse 
FINALLLYYYYYYY!

Here is the flag:

```bash
flag{t3l3gr4m_ftw}
```
