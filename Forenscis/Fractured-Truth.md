# Fractured Truth
>Not everything broken can be trusted to tell the truth. Among the fragments lies deception, but only one message is whole. Can you sort the chaos and reveal what was meant to be seen?

Fellas, a zip file *tiles.7z* is given.  
Let us first unzip it.

8 imagesâ€”seems like parts of a QR code.

Let us try to reassemble them. The images seem to be parts of quadrants, 2 images per quadrant. I renamed them for my ease:

<img width="1063" height="321" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce8121dd-c306-408e-8154-9b8053f9759e" />

I am a lazy person, so I created a Python script to do this:

```python
  from PIL import Image

# Load your 4 PNG images (replace with actual image file paths)
TL1 = Image.open('TL1.png')
TL2 = Image.open('TL2.png')
TR1 = Image.open('TR1.png')
TR2 = Image.open('TR2.png')
LL1 = Image.open('LL1.png')
LL2 = Image.open('LL2.png')
RL1 = Image.open('RL1.png')
RL2 = Image.open('RL2.png')

# Create a function to generate a single image based on quadrant choices
def generate_image(tl, tr, ll, rl):
    # Concatenate the images for TL, TR, LL, RL quadrants
    TL = tl
    TR = tr
    LL = ll
    RL = rl

    # Calculate the final image size
    final_width = TL.width + TR.width
    final_height = TL.height + LL.height

    # Create a new blank image with the calculated size
    final_image = Image.new('RGBA', (final_width, final_height))

    # Paste each quadrant image into the final image
    final_image.paste(TL, (0, 0))
    final_image.paste(TR, (TL.width, 0))
    final_image.paste(LL, (0, TL.height))
    final_image.paste(RL, (TL.width, TL.height))

    return final_image

# List all possible combinations of quadrants (TL, TR, LL, RL)
combinations = [
    (TL1, TR1, LL1, RL1),
    (TL1, TR1, LL1, RL2),
    (TL1, TR1, LL2, RL1),
    (TL1, TR1, LL2, RL2),
    (TL1, TR2, LL1, RL1),
    (TL1, TR2, LL1, RL2),
    (TL1, TR2, LL2, RL1),
    (TL1, TR2, LL2, RL2),
    (TL2, TR1, LL1, RL1),
    (TL2, TR1, LL1, RL2),
    (TL2, TR1, LL2, RL1),
    (TL2, TR1, LL2, RL2),
    (TL2, TR2, LL1, RL1),
    (TL2, TR2, LL1, RL2),
    (TL2, TR2, LL2, RL1),
    (TL2, TR2, LL2, RL2)
]

# Generate and save each combination as a separate image
for i, combo in enumerate(combinations):
    final_image = generate_image(*combo)
    final_image.save(f'final_image_{i+1}.png')
    final_image.show()  # Optional, to show each generated image
    print(f"Generated and saved final_image_{i+1}.png")
```

Oh nice! Got 16 QR codes. Most of them are useless, but two are important. Scan both of them; one of them is a decoy.

<img width="263" height="263" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fb8538c-66f2-47f4-b0dc-ba7fcbafefba" />

Just scan it with any QR scanner.

The final flag is:
```bash
flag{puzzl3d_qr_c0mpl3t3}
```
