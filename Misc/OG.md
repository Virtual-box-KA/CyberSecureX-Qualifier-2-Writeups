Given a file with G-code.

I searched what G-code is and found that G-codes are used for CNC machines to define paths and other variables.

I searched if there are any online services available to plot those, and found a website called **NC Viewer**.

This looked like a Pastebin URL and yes, it was.

Agh, again G-codes. Plotted it, and finally got the flag.

### The final flag is:
```bash
flag{G_m4n_h3h3}
```
