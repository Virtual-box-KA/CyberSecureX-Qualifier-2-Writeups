A zip file *wall.jpg.gz* is given, extract it.  
We got an image; visually, it's just a wall, nothing unusual.

Let us check for any stegno using:

```bash
steghide info wall.jpg
````

Okay, there is something fishy, it's asking for a password ðŸ˜„. Got some clue from steghide.
Just brute force the password using the command:

```bash
stegcrack wall.jpg /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

This will crack the password.

Here, stegcrack gave us a file as well. Open it.

Yeahhhhhh! The final flag is:

```bash
flag{E4SY_ST3G_UNL0CK3D}
```
