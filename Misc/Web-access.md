Given - A zip file, web_access

Let us try to extract it, 
It asks for password. Let us try to bruteforce if

Using 
```bash
zip2john web_access > hash.txt
john hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

Okay, it Took a day but coundnt bruteforce it

Later comes the hint

Yeaaaah ! That's the password, Got another file. 
Seems a log file for some website

I analyzed the file, as the description said. It showed a pattern of sql injection attack. There is a keyword `SUBSTRING` filtered for that and noted the values and got the flag.

The flag is:
```bash
flag{sql_injecti0n_attack}
```
