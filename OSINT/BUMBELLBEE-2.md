# BUMBELLBEE-2

> He's back. Check the last CTF. Who is this Bumbellbee? Check for the latest techniques he used for hacking.

In the last CTF, we were asked to figure out what Bumbellbee was, and it was associated with Ethical-buddy.  
So, I visited his GitHub repo.

Checked for the latest git commit in any repo (taking a hint from the description).

Found one:

Finally, the flag is:

```bash
flag{Y3S_1_U5E_4i_to_hack}
