# Ghost in the Wires

> They say once something is uploaded online, it never truly disappears. Can you find what was left behind by this OC?

Here, I found the keywords **OC** and **Ghost**.

I rushed to Discord and saw the admins in the CybersecureX Discord Channel.  

There are 4 admins:  
1. ethical-buddy  
2. UnethicalBuddy  
3. Robots_txt  
4. root_kitten  

They also have roles as OC in the Discord.

As the description says, *Ghost, uploaded online, cannot be deleted online*, it probably means **GitHub**, since it has version control.

1. UnethicalBuddy posted write-ups for the last CTF, got his GitHub from there. Nothing exciting over there.  
2. Then ethical-buddy â€” a single Google search is enough to find his GitHub. Nothing here as well.  
3. Couldn't find much about Robots_txt.  
4. I searched for the Discord username `root_kitten` and found a GitHub profile.

Nothing found ;-;

It says **deleted**, so we can try the Wayback Machine.

I tried Wayback Machine on all the admins. Unfortunately, found nothing unusual for ethical-buddy and UnethicalBuddy, but there are some URLs for root_kitten:

Clicked on the first link and found it!

The flag is:

```bash
flag{WAYBACK_IS_THE_KEY}
