## Writeup  

In this challenge, one photo was given which was a satellite image. The task was to find the username from it.  

I directly uploaded the image on Google and from there I found a website link of Twitter (X) where the same image was posted. When I opened that post, I got the username of the person who posted it.  

That username was the flag.  

**Flag:** `flag{jembobineuse}`
