# The Trained Few

> How many people did we officially train for the Red & Blue event?

Here, we have a keyword: **Officially**.  
KIET Group of Institutions is hosting this whole event.

Let us check the official handles of KIET to see if there is something about **training** or something similar related to this CTF.

In the description, it mentions the numbers **96 on 21 Aug** and **65 on 24 Aug**.

> Flag Format: `flag{XXX}`, where XXX = number

Adding those numbers gives us **161**.

So, the final flag is:

```bash
flag{161}
